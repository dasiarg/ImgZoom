ImgZoom
=======

A simple and lightweight Javascript function which allows to open an image in widescreen with an overlay


========

You will just need to: <br>
1- Include imgzoom.js in your HTML document <br>
2- Include JQuery <br>
3- call .imgZoom() on the image you want to open in widescreen  <br>

It is also possible to open a specific image with .imgZoom('path/to/file')

I will add features and link a demo ASAP
