ImgZoom
=======

A simple and lightweight Javascript function which allows to open an image in widescreen


========

You will just need to: <br>
1- Include imgzoom.js in your HTML document <br>
2- Set the onClick attribute to the images you want to open: onClick="extend(this.src)"  <br>

If you want to open a different image (e.g. a bigger image) use onclick="extend('path/to/file.jpg')";

An example is provided at the page http://twentyone.github.io/imgzoom.html (take a look of the source)

ImgZoom doesn't use Jquery, so you won't need to include it
