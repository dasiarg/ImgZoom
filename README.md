ImgZoom
=======

A simple and lightweight Javascript function which allows to open an image in widescreen


========

You will just need to: <br>
1- Include wall.js in your HTML document <br>
2- Add style.css to your HTML document (or put its content into your css file) <br>
3- Add a div element with "Wallpaper" as id (possibly at the beginning of the body) <br>
4- Set the onClick attribute to the images you want to open: onClick="extend(this.src)"  <br>

If you want to open a different image (e.g. a bigger image) use onclick="extend('path/to/file.jpg')";

An example is provided at the page http://twentyone.github.io/imgzoom.html
